# Shift Allocation Program

The Shift Allocation Program is a Java-based application designed to allocate shifts to different agents/workers.

This program was initially created and started as a project for an university course and by request of my employer. Please note that the program is still a work-in-progress, and some aspects, particularly the graphical user interface (GUI), may be clunky and require further refinement. However, despite its ongoing development, it has already proven to be highly effective in reducing the time needed for shift allocation across departments, achieving an approximately 80% reduction in allocation time and it has already been used by my employee for a year.

## Features

- **Agent Management**: The program provides functionality to add, update, and remove agents from the system. Each agent can be assigned a unique identification number and can be associated with various attributes such as team number, shift preferences, and availability.

- **Workshift Creation**: You can create and define workshifts within the program. A workshift includes details such as name, date, start time, end time, responsibility group, and whether it lasts for the entire day. Workshifts can be easily managed and modified as needed.

- **Allocation and Scheduling**: The program facilitates the allocation of workshifts to agents based on their availability, preferences, and assigned responsibilities. It ensures that shifts are evenly distributed among workers and takes into account any specific requirements or constraints.

- **Default Shifts**: The program supports the creation of default shifts for each day of the week. You can define predefined workshift templates that can be automatically generated for a given date, saving time and effort in shift planning.

- **Data Persistence**: The program provides functionality to save and load agent and workshift data to/from files. This ensures that your data is stored and can be easily accessed for future use.

## Getting Started and usage

Please note that currently, there is no pre-built JAR file available for the program. You need to compile and run the program using an IDE or a command-line Java compiler.

Please refer to the JavaDoc documentation within the code for detailed information about classes, methods, and their usage.

Further instructions on how to efficiently work with Excel files and download/upload absences/reservations and more features will be provided in future updates of the program.

To use the Shift Allocation Program right now, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

3. Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

4. Build and compile the program.

5. Run the application.
